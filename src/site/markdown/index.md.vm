${project.name}
===============

${project.description}

This `${project.artifactId}` detects some illegal changes to a Java
project's API.

How it works
---------------

APILyzer looks for deviations from the following rules.

* Public API members should use other Public API types.
* Public API members should use an approved set of types.

APILyzer allows easy declaration of Public API Types and approved types.  The
public members of the public API types are analyzed to ensure only expected
types are used.  Public members include public methods, public fields, and
public inner classes.  Protected classes and members are treated as public
during analysis.

Other tools
---------------

This tool fills a niche not covered by other tools, like [Animal Sniffer][1]
and [checkstyle import control][2]. A project that wants to ensure API
stability would likely use these tools in addition to APILyzer. Import
analysis differs because it's ok for a public API class to import a non-public
API class for use only in its implementation. Comparing new API changes to
signatures of a previous API differs because it only validates that the old
API is not broken.

Getting Started
---------------

To add this plugin to your project, configure the plugin similarly to:

```xml
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>apilyzer</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>analyze</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <includes>
                <!--Specify one or more regular expressions that define the
                    public API.  Each regex is matched agains all fully
                    qualified class names.  Any class that matches (and is
                    public) is added to the set of public API classes.-->
                <include>org[.]apache[.]accumulo[.]minicluster[.].*</include>
              </includes>
              <excludes>
                <!-- Specifiy zero or more regular expressions. Any regex that
                     matches will exclude a prevously included class from the
                     set of API classes -->
                <exclude>.*[.]impl[.].*</exclude>
                <exclude>.*Impl</exclude>
              </excludes>
              <allows>
                <!-- Specify zero or more regular expressions defining the set
                     of non-API classes thats it ok for public API members to
                     reference.  These regular expressions are matched against
                     fully qualified type names referenced by public API
                     members.  Conceptually, public API classes and Java classes
                     are automatically added to this set, so there is no need
                     to add those here. -->
                <allow>org[.]apache[.]accumulo[.]core[.]client[.].*</allow>
                <allow>org[.]apache[.]accumulo[.]core[.]data[.](Mutation|Key|Value|Condition|ConditionalMutation|Range|ByteSequence|PartialKey|Column)</allow>
                <allow>org[.]apache[.]accumulo[.]core[.]security[.](ColumnVisibility|Authorizations)</allow>
              </allows>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
```

and build your project, similarly to (it runs at the [verify][3] phase by default):

```
mvn verify
```

Below is the output of running the above command.

```
Includes: [org[.]apache[.]accumulo[.]minicluster[.].*]
Excludes: [.*[.]impl[.].*, .*Impl]
Allowed: [org[.]apache[.]accumulo[.]core[.]client[.].*, org[.]apache[.]accumulo[.]core[.]data[.](Mutation|Key|Value|Condition|ConditionalMutation|Range|ByteSequence|PartialKey|Column), org[.]apache[.]accumulo[.]core[.]security[.](ColumnVisibility|Authorizations)]

Public API:
org.apache.accumulo.minicluster.MemoryUnit
org.apache.accumulo.minicluster.MiniAccumuloCluster
org.apache.accumulo.minicluster.MiniAccumuloConfig
org.apache.accumulo.minicluster.MiniAccumuloInstance
org.apache.accumulo.minicluster.MiniAccumuloRunner
org.apache.accumulo.minicluster.MiniAccumuloRunner$Opts
org.apache.accumulo.minicluster.MiniAccumuloRunner$PropertiesConverter
org.apache.accumulo.minicluster.ServerType

CONTEXT              TYPE                                                         FIELD/METHOD                        NON-PUBLIC REFERENCE

Method return        org.apache.accumulo.minicluster.MiniAccumuloInstance         getConfigProperties(...)            org.apache.commons.configuration.PropertiesConfiguration
Method param         org.apache.accumulo.minicluster.MiniAccumuloInstance         lookupInstanceName(...)             org.apache.accumulo.fate.zookeeper.ZooCache
```
The output shows the 8 types that APILyzer determined to be public API types
based on its configuration and the maven dependencies.  These are the 8 types
that APILyzer analyzed.

The output also shows two problems APILyzer found with these 8 types.  Both
problems are with public API methods.  The first problem is
`MiniAccumuloInstance.getConfigProperties()` returns `PropertiesConfiguration`
which is not a public API type.  The second problem is
`MiniAccumuloInstance.lookupInstanceName()` takes a parameter of type
`ZooCache` which is not a public API type.

## Annotation Example

Hadoop has two annotations that it uses to communicate who should use its APIs.  First, the
`InterfaceAudience` annotation has values of `Public`, `LimitedPrivate`, and `Private`.  Second, the
`InterfaceStability` annotation has values of `Stable`, `Evolving`, and `Unstable`. In Hadoop the
convention is to mark each API with an audience and stability annotation. The following example
finds types marked Public+Stable using types that are not Public+Stable.

When trying to analyze a classes annotations, the class must be loaded. In the example below some
classes could not be loaded because their dependencies were not on the classpath. However these
classes were not in a package we cared about. Excluding classes not in the `org.apache.hadoop`
package fixed this problem.

```xml
  <configuration>
     <!--Look for Public+Stable APIs using Types that are not Public+Stable-->
     <includes>
       <!-- This class has no annotation, but seems like it sould be in API -->
       <include>org[.]apache[.]hadoop[.]fs[.]RemoteIterator</include>
     </includes>
     <includeAnnotations>
       <include>
         [@]org[.]apache[.]hadoop[.]classification[.]InterfaceAudience[$]Public.*
       </include>
     </includeAnnotations>
     <excludeAnnotations>
       <exclude>
         [@]org[.]apache[.]hadoop[.]classification[.]InterfaceStability[$]Evolving.*
       </exclude>
       <exclude>
         [@]org[.]apache[.]hadoop[.]classification[.]InterfaceStability[$]Unstable.*
       </exclude>
       <!-- If a class is included in the API, then its public inner classes are also (unless excluded).
            This exclude is for the case where a type w/ Private annotation is an inner class of a class
            with a Public annotation -->
       <exclude>
         [@]org[.]apache[.]hadoop[.]classification[.]InterfaceAudience[$](Limited)?Private.*
       </exclude>
    </excludeAnnotations>
     <excludes>
        <!-- Exclude all classes not in the org.apache.hadoop package -->
        <exclude>(?!org[.]apache[.]hadoop.*).*</exclude>
     </excludes>
  </configuration>
