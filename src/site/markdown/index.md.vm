Description
-----------

  A simple maven plugin that detects some illegal changes to a Java project's
  API.

How it works
------------

  APILyzer looks for deviations from the following rules.

  * Public API members should use other Public API types.
  * Public API members should use an approved set of types.

  APILyzer allows easy declaration of Public API Types and approved types.  The
  public members of the public API types are analyzed to ensure only expected
  types are used.  Public members include public methods, public fields, and
  public inner classes.  Protected classes and members are treated as public
  during analysis.

Other tools
-----------

  This tool fills a niche not covered by other tools, like [Animal Sniffer][1]
  and [checkstyle import control][2]. A project that wants to ensure API
  stability would likely use these tools in addition to APILyzer. Import
  analysis differs because it's ok for a public API class to import a non-public
  API class for use only in its implementation. Comparing new API changes to
  signatures of a previous API differs because it only validates that the old
  API is not broken.

How to use it
-------------

  To add this plugin to your project, configure the plugin similarly to:

```xml
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>apilyzer</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>analyze</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <includes>
                <!--Specify one or more regular expressions that define the
                    public API.  Each regex is matched agains all fully
                    qualified class names.  Any class that matches (and is
                    public) is added to the set of public API classes.-->
                <include>org[.]apache[.]accumulo[.]minicluster[.].*</include>
              </includes>
              <excludes>
                <!-- Specifiy zero or more regular expressions. Any regex that
                     matches will exclude a prevously included class from the
                     set of API classes -->
                <exclude>.*[.]impl[.].*</exclude>
                <exclude>.*Impl</exclude>
              </excludes>
              <allows>
                <!-- Specify zero or more regular expressions defining the set
                     of non-API classes thats it ok for public API members to
                     reference.  These regular expressions are matched against
                     fully qualified type names referenced by public API
                     members.  Conceptually, public API classes and Java classes
                     are automatically added to this set, so there is no need
                     to add those here. -->
                <allow>org[.]apache[.]accumulo[.]core[.]client[.].*</allow>
                <allow>org[.]apache[.]accumulo[.]core[.]data[.](Mutation|Key|Value|Condition|ConditionalMutation|Range|ByteSequence|PartialKey|Column)</allow>
                <allow>org[.]apache[.]accumulo[.]core[.]security[.](ColumnVisibility|Authorizations)</allow>
              </allows>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
```

  and build your project, similarly to (it runs at the verify phase by default):

```
mvn verify
```

  Below is the output of running the above command.
